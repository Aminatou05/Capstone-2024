The Search component is a React component that allows users to search for listings. It integrates with a backend API to fetch and display relevant listings based on search criteria. and i used toLocaleString() method to format numbers in JavaScript with commas in my Search.jsx page and ListingItem page. used  react icons on my search forms and listings page with he Swiper component, thereâ€™s a conditional check for saleListings (presumably an array of sale listings).
If saleListings exists and has a length greater than 0, the code maps over each listing and creates a SwiperSlide for each one. lastly, I used Tailwind CSS to styles my frontend.
